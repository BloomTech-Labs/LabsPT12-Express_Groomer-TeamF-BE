# APIs

## Authentication (Okta)

Okta authentication uses the `profileRouter` and `profileModel` files. Data persists in the `profile` table.

## Locations

Groomer business locations are stored in the `locations` table. The `locationRouter` and `locationModel` access and store the location data.

## Pets

Pet data is stored in the `pets` table. The `petRouter` and `petModel` access and store the location data.

## Getting Started

### Enviornment Variables

- `PORT` - API port (optional, but helpful with FE running as well)
  - The following ports are whitelisted for use with okta
    - 3000
    - 8000
    - 8080
- `DATABASE_URL` - connection string for postgres database
- `OKTA_URL_ISSUER` - The complete issuer URL for verifying okta access tokens. `https://example.okta.com/oauth2/default`
- `OKTA_CLIENT_ID` - the okta client ID.

See `.env` file for example values

### Setup postgres

There are 3 options to get postgresql installed locally [Choose one]:

1. Use docker. [Install](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) for your platform
   - run: `docker-compose up -d` to start up the postgresql database and pgadmin.
   - Open a browser to [pgadmin](http://localhost:5050/) and you should see the Dev server already defined.
   - If you need to start over you will need to delete the folder `$ rm -rf ./data/pg` as this is where all of the server data is stored.
     - if the database `api-dev` was not created then start over.
2. Download and install postgresql directly from the [main site](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
   - make note of the port, username and password you use to setup the database.
   - Connect your client to the server manually using the values previously mentioned
   - You will need to create a database manually using a client.
   - Make sure to update the DATABASE_URL connection string with the values for username/password, databasename and server port (if not 5432).
3. Setup a free account at [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com/plans.html)
   - Sign up for a free `Tiney Turtle` plan
   - copy the URL to the DATABASE_URL .env variable
   - make sure to add `?ssl=true` to the end of this url

### Setup the application

- create your project repo by forking or using this as a template.
- run: `npm install` to download all dependencies.
- confirm correct env variables in your `.env` file.
- run: `npm run knex migrate:latest` to create the starting schema.
- run: `npm run knex seed:run` to populate your db with some data.
- run: `npm run tests` to confirm all is setup and tests pass.
- run: `npm run watch:dev` to start nodemon in local dev enviornment.

> Make sure to update the details of the app name, description and version in
> the `package.json` and `config/jsdoc.js` files.

# Project Status

## Summary

Release #: 2 <br>
Release status: In progress<br>
Trello Board: https://trello.com/b/ZfhxRCcq/labs-pt12-express-groomer-team-f<br>
Whimsical (Architecture): https://whimsical.com/architecture-diagram-ADh8unt91rRsvfsWk3YLfA<br>
Whimsical (User Flow): https://whimsical.com/express-groomer-UAEP3cKj4Nm9ZH5vxoaw7M<br>

## Features Completed

The backend supports the following app features:

- The API is a fully functional Node/Express web application interfacing with a Postgres db
- Knex is used as the query builder used to create database model functions
- Authentication middleware enables the front end to use Okta authentication
- Authorization middleware in the `pets` route handlers restricts changes made to pet records. Only the pet’s owner is permitted to modify a pet record, including updating or deleting it

- There are three database tables:

  1. `profiles` : The profile data populated from both Okta and user entries
  2. `locations` : The groomer’s business location data, including business name and address
  3. `pets` : The client’s pet data, including pet name, type, and a flag for whether the pet has all shots up to date

- Each table has an accompany node router:

  1. `profileRouter`, for controlling the data to/from the `profiles` table
  2. `locationRouter`, for controlling data to/from the `locations` table
  3. `petRouter`, for controlling data to/from the `pets` table

Using the `profiles` table and the `profileRouter`, users can:

- Create an account and register as either a client or a groomer
- Users of either type can login using Okta authentication
- Users can persist user profile data in the `profiles` table using the `profileRouter`

Using the `locations` table and `locationRouter`, users can:

- Groomers can add profile data in their profile page with information about their business
- The Mapbox component can reference the latitude and longitude of a groomer's location (support for this)
- The Mapbox component can include the groomer's business name in the popup (support for this)

Using the `pets` table and `petRouter`, users can:

- Clients can enter pet details in their profile or pet pages and save the data to the `pets` table

There are basic unit tests of all route handlers and their HTTP methods.

## Features Still Remaining

1. Finish release 2

- Add a pet health issues table and pet health issues router
- Add a join table for a many-to-many relationship between pet health issues and pets, `pets_healthissues`
- Add an `appointments` table as per the architecture document:
  (Whimsical Architecture Diagram)[https://whimsical.com/architecture-diagram-ADh8unt91rRsvfsWk3YLfA]
- Add backend middleware, utils or controllers necessary to render data in an easy to use format for the frontend, especially for the `appointments` related features. For instance, one user story reads "As a groomer, I want to be able to see the requests that I get from users and manage them". It would be ideal to structure that data and output it in the desired manner for the front end devs to facilitate development.
- Add a `favorites` table with saved favorite groomers that the users can access and manage (full CRUD is probably needed)

2. All release 3 features, including those for the following user stories:

- As a client, I want to be able to pay in a convenient and fast way (Stripe)
- As a groomer, I want to be able to process payments from the customers and receive them in my bank account (Stripe)
- As a client, I want to be able to rate groomers based on my experience and provide comments
